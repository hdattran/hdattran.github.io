Welcome to my homepage!

[You can check out my most updated CV here!](/files/CV_HDatTran.pdf)

My name is H. Dat Tran (Dat, for simplicity). I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the [University of Central Arkansas (UCA) School of Communication](https://uca.edu/communication/) starting Fall 2025. My research focuses on political communication, particularly political identity, polarization, and hostility; emerging culture/media; social networks; and journalism and media studies, with a special attention on traditionally underrepresented countries in the Global South. A mixed-methods scholar who falls in love with research (and, of course, my wife, who is currently an ABD at the Manship School), I often tell people I know that I do research to relax between stressful rounds of Mario Kart (and mean it).

My teaching philosophy aims to help students (1) learn something that will be useful to them, whether in their careers or in their everyday lives, and have fun learning it and (2) understand that true success is rooted in being a decent human being. I strive to create an inclusive and supportive classroom environment where students feel empowered to express their ideas, challenge assumptions, and grow both intellectually and personally. The ultimate goal is for students to leave my class not just with knowledge, but with a stronger sense of purpose and integrity.

I received a PhD in Media & Public Affairs from the Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University (Geaux Tigers!), where I was an instructor-on-record for MC 3504: Introduction to Political Communication and MC 4090: Media Ethics and Social Responsibility from Fall 2023 to Spring 2025. Before that, I earned a Master of Science in Mass Communications from the A. Q. Miller School of Journalism and Mass Communications at Kansas State University (#EMAW) and a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism and Communication from the University of Social Sciences and Humanities at Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City.

Before joining academia, I have had extensive experience as a journalist covering social issues, international affairs/relations, culture, and tourism in Vietnam. I have also worked professionally as an editor, content creator/executive, and PR specialist. I am currently a mentor and senior advisor for the [Asian Network of News & Information Educators (ANNIE) School Netâ€™s Campus Fact-Checking Project](https://talk.annieasia.org/p/annie-school-net-campus-fact-checking).

My other hobbies include Family Guy, the MCU, and annoying my wife with my shenanigans.

Please feel free to [reach out to me via email](mailto:thdat285@gmail.com) for access to my publications that are behind paywalls, as well as with feedback and questions, for media and speaking requests, or to hire me. I truly love what I do and look forward to hearing from you so that we can find ways to help make the world a better place!
