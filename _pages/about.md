Welcome to my homepage!
My name is H. Dat Tran. I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the [University of Central Arkansas (UCA) School of Communication](https://uca.edu/communication/) starting Fall 2025. MY research focuses on political communication, particularly political identity, polarization, and hostility; emerging culture/media; social networks; and journalism and media studies, with a special focus on traditionally underrepresented countries in the Global South.
