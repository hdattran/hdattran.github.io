Social media have increasingly become an integral part of news production and altered the way news organizations operate. In our study, thus, we apply the diffusion of innovation theory (Rogers, 2003) to investigate (1) social media adoption in Vietnamese newsrooms, (2) factors that encourage or discourage journalists to adopt social media, and (3) journalists’ perceptions of social media’s impact on their work, as well as newsroom leadership when it comes to encouraging and assisting journalists in effectively incorporating social media into journalistic practices. Results from 374 survey responses from journalists working in major mainstream news organizations in Vietnam (N = 374) indicate that Vietnamese journalists are more inclined to adopt social media into their journalistic practices if they think that these innovations can offer clear advantages and increase efficiency. On the other hand, social media adoption is discouraged if journalists perceive these platforms as complicating their workflows. In examining how newsrooms may encourage and assist journalists in incorporating social media into their work, we find that policies regarding the adoption of social media in the newsrooms differ across the forms of journalism that the newsrooms practice. Specific policies, such as promoting journalists’ autonomy, organizing training programs, and establishing specialized positions dedicated to social media, may facilitate acceptance of social media adoption among journalists.
